About Bogota # Bogotá, the bustling capital of Colombia, offers a dynamic and vibrant venue for events, gatherings, and tourism. Nestled high in the Andes Mountains at an altitude of 2,640 meters, the city is a blend of rich cultural heritage and modern urban life. Bogotá\u0026rsquo;s historic center, La Candelaria, is a focal point for visitors, boasting colonial-era landmarks, museums, and cultural institutions. The city is also home to a thriving gastronomic scene, eclectic nightlife, and numerous parks and green spaces, making it an attractive destination for a wide range of activities. Among Bogotá\u0026rsquo;s many attractions, the José Celestino Mutis Botanical Garden stands out as a serene oasis in the heart of the city. This expansive garden, named after the renowned Spanish botanist, is the largest in Colombia and showcases a diverse collection of native flora from various Colombian ecosystems. Visitors can wander through beautifully landscaped areas, greenhouses, and thematic gardens that highlight the country\u0026rsquo;s rich biodiversity. The TransMilenio bus rapid transit system is the backbone of the city\u0026rsquo;s public transport network, offering an extensive and efficient service across major routes. In recent years, Bogotá has also embraced a well-developed bike-sharing system known as Tembici. This initiative encourages both residents and visitors to explore the city on two wheels, promoting an environmentally friendly and healthy mode of transport. The city boasts over 500 kilometers of dedicated bike lanes, making it one of the most bike-friendly cities in Latin America. Transportation # Ubers and Taxis. If you are a local or are familiar with public transportation in Bogota, we highly encourage you to use Uber or taxis. Uber is safe and cheap (most rides within the city will be less than $5 USD). You can also use the Uber app to order taxis. Public transportation. TransMilenio is the main public transportation system in Bogota. It is integrated with Google Maps. In peak hours, the system tends to be overloaded.
